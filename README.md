Coding Structure
================

    1) we have to use the variables and method name as CamelNotation or else as a word followed by underscore(_), it means the starting word must be is small case and the following next word should be starting with capital letter.
        eg:
            var isSearch;
            var is_search;

            function getInput()
            function get_input()

    2) Variables and function naming should be reasonable and readable name.
        eg:
            var fNameVal;

            for label use as fNameLbl

    3) There must be equal spacing from margin for each and every function and line.

    4) Curly braces should be closed properly and it should be in same ladder.
        eg:
            if()
            {
                // Body
            }

    5) There must be proper comments for each and every constants, Functions, templates and even at the time of Bug fixes.


Project Standards
=================

    1) If we are planning to do some animation effects no need to use functionality, its better to use the CSS properties. If there is no CSS properties we can use the functionalities.

    2) Use a constants files in a separate file.

    3) If we are designing a hybrid project use the common variables and common functions in same file, if certain functionalities and variables are specific to a product use in its appropriate file with proper naming convention.

    4) Use proper flag variables for each and every modules.

    5) For each and every code check-in the release notes should be updated in the github.
